# Easelly Setup Matomo locally.

Jumping between different workstations can be a hazzle.

So I keep track of my changes in this repo if I need to jump between computers.



## Install Matomo
```bash
make install
```

## Install Premium plugins
```bash
make premium
```

## Install Custom plugins

To make it easier to install cutom plugins from any other git repo, I made it easier to keep track of them using a `.json` file
```bash
make premium
```
